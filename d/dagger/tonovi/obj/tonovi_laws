All races are allowed within the city limits. Sub-human species such as but not limited to drow, kobold, hobgoblin, ogre, etc. are allowed in the city but will be watched constantly.  Since Tonovi does not consider these species true 'races', they are held to a different standard which is to be determined by the city authorities at the given time.

Weapons will not be wielded in Tonovi except by designated officials.  If a weapon is visible, it will be considered wielded.  All mage books and bags are considered weapons, therefore they will not be wielded or visible at any time.  If they are, they will be considered unsheathed weapons and are subject to the penalties listed below.  The only exception is in the study room which is located within the Tonovi Inn.  No magic will be cast at any time while within the city of Tonovi except by designated officials.

The killing of any person within the city of Tonovi by anyone other than proper authorities will result in the guilty being executed publicly.  Attacks that do not result in death will result in the guilty being tortured publicly.

The city of Tonovi holds the right to ban any person and any race at any time for any reason.  Banned persons or races found within the city of Tonovi will be publicly tortured.  New additions and deletions to the banned persons will be posted on the city board.

All property of any person tortured, executed or otherwise killed in the city of Tonovi will be confiscated and absorbed into the city coffer.

All items sold in stores have been taxed at an appropriate level by the New Dawn.  All items sold outside of proper stores will require the buyer to pay a %^CYAN%^10% tax %^RESET%^to the nearest guard or city authority.  Failure to do so will result in immediate seizure of the items in question and the public torture of the buyer.

Any attempt to overthrow the government will be seen as an act of war and will be treated as such.  If all parties involved are captured, they will be publicly tortured.

Any person found to have escaped justice for any crime listed herein will be considered a wanted criminal.  Upon capture by proper Tonovi authorities, a public execution will be held.
