%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
The oldest of the orc species, and the most numerous, these are the savage conquerers of orc kind. They appear as savage as they act, with tall and stocky frames, porcine snouts and large tusks. They possess red eyes, and usually black hair, which they weave with braids and tiny bones. They wear only crude clothing at best, and decorate their bodies with scars and warpaint. They are a warlike folk, convinced that one day they shall crush the civilized world and take what is rightfully theirs. However, most of their time is spent upon infighting among themselves, preventing them from making sufficient headway on this goal.

%^RED%^Warning:%^RESET%^ This is an advanced race, known as a PK-race. It imposes disadvantages on your gameplay: You will be banned in most cities and shunned across the realm. You start with your NOPK-flag turned off and other players may attack you because of your race. You may not, however, attack a player of a standard race without additional provocation.
