%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Bugbears are giant, hairy relatives of goblins. They are about 7 feet tall, with muscular frames. They have good sight and hearing, and are very stealthy. Their hide varies from a light yellow shade to a darker yellow brown, and their hair ranges in color from brown to bright red. Their eyes are a greenish white color, and are almost like those of a large predator, they have red pupils that denote their infravision. Their ears are triangular and rest closer to the tops of their heads. Long, sharp fangs fill their mouth. They have a keen sense of smell with their bear-like nose, which is actually how they earned the name bugbear. They prefer to be in caves and underground lairs. They eat humans and humanoids smaller than themselves. They are also extremely greedy creatures and love shiny items.

%^RED%^Warning:%^RESET%^ This is an advanced race, known as a PK-race. It imposes disadvantages on your gameplay: You will be banned in most cities and shunned across the realm. You start with your NOPK-flag turned off and other players may attack you because of your race. You may not, however, attack a player of a standard race without additional provocation.
